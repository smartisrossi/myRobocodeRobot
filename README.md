# Learning agent for Robocode
This repository contains three versions of a Robocode tank that learns how to defeat its enemy. In particular, the agent implements a Reinforcement Learning algorithm, the Q-learning algorithm. The difference among the Robocode tanks involves only the RL algorithm implementation; there is a tabular Q-learning version, an agent which uses a Neural Network for function approximation and the third one adds Experience Replay. The project has been developed for the "CPEN 502 - Architectures for Learning Systems" course, University of British Columbia.
